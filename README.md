Welcome to my GitHub! I’m Folashade Oluwaseun, better known as "Starr"—a dedicated system administrator with over four years of experience in IT infrastructure. Here, you’ll find a collection of my projects, technologies used, and experiences in the Iech Space.

As an advocate for women in tech, I am committed to empowering others and creating opportunities for women in the industry. I have trained and educated individuals at several boot camps/workshops, sharing knowledge on various technologies and best practices.

I’m passionate about empowering through technology while helping others grow in tech. Through my brand, StarrInTheCloud, I actively promote women in tech, share insights on cloud education, and foster community-building.
